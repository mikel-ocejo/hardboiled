# Hardboiled implementation for Foundry VTT

An implementation of Hardboiled system for foundry-vtt  

## Disclaimer

This is a minimal system created to play some Hardboiled adventures at Horror Cósmico Discord server.

I’ve just provided some basics skills that you can use.

## Installation/usage

Install in foundry VTT from the Game Systems tab using the following manifest :  
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sharcashmo/hardboiled/master/system.json>  

## What is working  

Version 0.0.1 :  

* The character sheet.  
  * You can enter your image, characteristics and traits.
  * Characteristics are rollable. Clicking on them opens a dialog to select a modifier before roll is done.
  * Dice so Nice! is supported.  

## Future plans
